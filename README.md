# GUSMap

This github repository is a pointer to the repository that contains the R package GUSMap (click on `GUSMap @ 2add53b' to go to the GUSMap main repository).

GUSMap is a package for constructing linkage maps on outcrossed full-sib populations using sequencing data, particularly low coverage sequencing data. The main novelty of the package is its ability to account for sequencing errors and genotyping errors caused by insufficient sequencing depth.
